# Digital Academic Credential Verification System

A secure, fast, and cost-effective platform for issuing and verifying academic credentials using cryptographic hashing and QR codes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Academic credential verification is currently:
- **Slow**: Takes 2-5 days for traditional verification
- **Costly**: Institutions charge fees for each verification request
- **Fraud-prone**: 78% of employers encounter falsified credentials
- **Inefficient**: No standardized instant verification mechanism

## 💡 Solution

An instant credential verification platform that:
- Verifies credentials in under 3 seconds
- Costs zero per verification
- Uses SHA-256 cryptographic hashing for tamper-proof security
- Provides QR code-based mobile verification
- Serves institutions, students, and employers through dedicated portals
